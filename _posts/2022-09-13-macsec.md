## What is MACSEC ? 
- Layer2 protocol which encrypts using gcm-aes encryption algorithm (128/256) and offers secure links in a LAN env. 
- secures a P2P link preventing man in the middle attacks, passive wire tapping
- secures all traffic including ARP and DHCP which IPSEC does not 
- operates at layer 2 as compared to IPSEC which operates at L3 

Due to the above protects all higher layer traffic (L2 and above) exiting the interface which is enabled with macsec.

## What does it offer ? 
- data integrity 
- Encryption 

![header](/images/macsec_header.png)

## Few acryonyms
- MKA (macsec key aggrement)  
- CA (Connectivity association)
    - macsec supports single CA per interface (IFD). If logical is used (vlan tags) the vlan tags are not encrypted. 
    - creates inbound and outbound connections

- CAK (connectivity association key)
    - can be static or dynamic 
    - static can be pre-shared-keys with/without automatic rollovers
    - In dynamic peer node generates the security keys as part of the authentication process. The CAK and CKN are dynamically generated to create a secure connection
    - hex value as input
    - stored encrypted. 

- CKN (connectivity association key name)
    - hex value (even numbered)
    - stored in plain text 

## Best practices
- full length CKN is 32octets preferred so that it can interop well.
- can compare CKN as username and CAK as password hence keep them different 
- use hitless key rollovers
- ensure both systems are the same time (although not required but preferred) 
- Ensure same transmit interval is programmed on both ends of the link. 6000ms (6s) is recommended. default is 2seconds.
- harden shared secrets (PSKs) using a master password
    ```
    set system master-password plain-text-password <password>
    ```
- use extended packet numbering (XPN) for high speed links. 

## Topology
![topology](/images/macsec.png)

## Configuration using static preshared key 

CAK can be static or dynamic. Below is the method to use static pre-shared keys 
```
root@mx480-a# show security
macsec {
    connectivity-association test1 {
        security-mode static-cak;
        pre-shared-key {
            ckn abcd1234abcd1234;
            cak "$9$tB1vu0IhclMWx/Cev8LN-k.mPFn/9pOBEikfz3nCAvW87bsoJG"; ## SECRET-DATA
        }
    }
```

### Bind the interface to use the static CAK
```
root@mx480-a# set security macsec interfaces et-5/1/0 connectivity-association test1
```

### Change encryption algorithm

By default picked gcm-aes-128. For high speed links >25g it is advisable to pick xpn based. if a different config is added, then you might see the below error. 

```
root@mx480-a# set security macsec connectivity-association test1 cipher-suite gcm-aes-256
```

### Warning that you might see 
```
[edit security macsec]
  'connectivity-association test1'
    warning: To maximize security, recommend configuring all 64 hexadecimal digits of pre-shared-key cak
[edit security macsec]
  'interfaces et-5/1/0'
    warning: Only XPN cipher suites should be configured on interface speed 25G and above
commit complete
```

Change to xpn based 

```
root@mx480-a# set security macsec connectivity-association att-test1 cipher-suite gcm-aes-xpn-256

[edit security macsec]
  'connectivity-association test1'
    warning: To maximize security, recommend configuring all 64 hexadecimal digits of pre-shared-key ckn
[edit security macsec]
  'connectivity-association test1'
    warning: To maximize security, recommend configuring all 64 hexadecimal digits of pre-shared-key cak
commit complete
```

the above can be safely ignored. Since this is a test setup

### Configure the interface
```
set interfaces et-5/1/0 description "test macsec"
set interfaces et-5/1/0 unit 0 family inet address 193.1.1.1/30
```

add similar configurations to the far end router on `mx480-b`

## How about overlays and other protocols  on top of the  masec interface ?
Macsec is a L2 encryption method. So anything heading out of the physical interface will get encrypted. Any protocol packets or overlays configured would be encrypted.

For example, below FTI interface has been configured. These L3-VXLAN packets traverse the macsec interface and would get encrypted. 

### Configuration
```
root@mx480-a# show interfaces fti0 | display set
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe source address 193.1.1.1
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe destination address 193.1.1.2
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe tunnel-endpoint vxlan
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe destination-udp-port 4789
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe vni 300
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 family inet address 194.1.1.1/30


root@mx480-b# show interfaces fti0 | display set
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe source address 193.1.1.2
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe destination address 193.1.1.1
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe tunnel-endpoint vxlan
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe destination-udp-port 4789
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 tunnel encapsulation vxlan-gpe vni 300
set interfaces fti0 unit 1 family inet address 194.1.1.2/30
```
### Verify

ping the FTI end point 

```
root@mx480-a# run ping 194.1.1.2
PING 194.1.1.2 (194.1.1.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 194.1.1.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.951 ms
64 bytes from 194.1.1.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.949 ms
64 bytes from 194.1.1.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.060 ms
```

notice the packets count is now `24` from `21`. The 3 packets were encrypted. 

```
root@mx480-b# run show security macsec statistics
  Interface name: et-3/2/0
    Secure Channel transmitted
        Encrypted packets: 24
        Encrypted bytes:   2226

        Validated bytes:   0
        Decrypted bytes:   2226
    Secure Association received
        Accepted packets:  24
        Validated bytes:   0
        Decrypted bytes:   0
```

## How about encrypting the VXLAN tunnel itself instead  of the underlying IFD ?
Lets say we want to encrypt the FTI tunnel interface itself ? This is not possible since we encrypt at IFD level. 

```
root@mx480-a# set interfaces fti0 connectivity-association test1
error: name: 'fti0': Only ethernet interfaces allowed
error: statement creation failed: fti0
```
we will discuss in the later section an alternative approach for such a requirement. These are useful when we want to replace IPSEC for site to site use cases which needs high throughput.

## Key chains
while rolling over keys in PSK method is not hitless. A way to solve this problem is use keychains and use hitless rollovers. Keychain is a set of keys (one or more) that can be added on the macsec devices. The important part here is the start-time knob which defines a future time at which the new key should be used. When the time reaches the defined value, the keys would be rolled over to the defined one. in this case, key1 would be used at time `2022-9-13.17:00:00`. There can be many number of keys so this way it can rollover accordingly.

### Configuration
```
[edit security]
+   authentication-key-chains {
+       key-chain chain1 {
+           key 1 {
+               secret "$9$JtUi.QF/0BEP5BEcyW8ZUjHP5z36AuO"; ## SECRET-DATA
+               key-name deadbeefcaf4;
+               start-time "2022-9-13.17:00:00 -0700";
+           }
+       }
+   }
```
The secret can be typed in plain text and it would salt it accordingly. Make sure you delete the knob pre-shared-key under `set security macsec connectivity-association test1 pre-shared-key`  since you are using `pre-shared-key-chain`. 
The secret should be a hex value. 

refer the new key-chain `chain1` 

```
set security macsec connectivity-association test1 pre-shared-key-chain chain1
``` 

add a future time on both sides. This way key management is easier and traffic is hitless when key roll overs happen.

## Macsec over GRE interface ? 

As discussed on the earlier sections, you can only encrypt on the IFD level and you cannot encrypt a tunnel itself like gre and vxlan. Since these occur at L3 , typically one would use IPSEC VPN to encrypt site to site traffic at L3. 
how can we encrypt tunnels so that we can encrypt at line rate ? lets say 400G of tunnel traffic encrypted ? Below method suggests a way to achieve the same. 

*This part is still a WIP* 

### Topology
![topology](/images/macsecogre.png)

### Create wan interface 
```
root@mx480-a# show interfaces et-5/1/0
description "test macsec";
unit 0 {
    family inet {
        address 193.1.1.1/30;
    }
}
```

### Create L2 gre interface
```
root@mx480-a# show | compare
[edit interfaces]
+   gr-5/2/10 {
+       description "macsec gre";
+       unit 0 {
+           tunnel {
+               source 193.1.1.1;
+               destination 193.1.1.2;
+           }
+           family bridge {
+               core-facing;
+               interface-mode trunk;
+               vlan-id 10;
+           }
+       }
+   }
```

### Loop the traffic to the L2 interface 
```
root@mx480-a# show interfaces et-5/1/1
description "loopback 5/1/2";
vlan-tagging;
unit 0 {
    family bridge {
        interface-mode trunk;
        vlan-id 10;
    }
}
```

### Create a L2 domain using virtual switch

place the L2 gre interface and the L2 interface in the same domain 
```
root@mx480-a# show routing-instances macsec
instance-type virtual-switch;
bridge-domains {
    bd {
        vlan-id 10;
        no-arp-suppression;
    }
}
interface et-5/1/1.0;
interface gr-5/2/10.0;
```

### Create a L3 interface on the other end of the looped interface
```
root@mx480-a# show interfaces et-5/1/2
description "loopback 5/1/1";
unit 0 {
    family inet {
        address 194.1.1.2/30 {
        }
    }
}
```

### Add the L3 interface into an L3 domain
```
root@mx480-a# show routing-instances macsec-l3
instance-type virtual-router;
interface et-5/1/2.0;
```
